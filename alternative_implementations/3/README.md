# Alternative implementation 3

This implementation is almost identical to implementation 2 (see its README.md file for more details). The only difference is that tool0 frame is now completely removed from the definition of sia20d robot arm and the wsg50 gripper is attached straight to the last link of the sia20d (link_t, whcih is the same link the tool0 frame is attached to in the original definition of sia20d).
