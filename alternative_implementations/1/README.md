# Alternative implementation 1

Here the sia20d robot arm is imported from its original source (motoman_sia20d_support/urdf/sia20d_macro.xacro) as it is. Also the wsg50 gripper is imported from its original source (wsg50_gripper/urdf/wsg_50.urdf.xacro) as it is. Then the two sia20d robot arms are created after which a wsg50 gripper is linked to each of them separately.
