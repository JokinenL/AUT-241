This workspace includes the packages generated by ourselves for the dual arm robot system including all its actions and services. The workspace also includes the original motoman packages and the original wsg50 gripper package that our implementation depends on. If you have already downloaded, built, and sourced the motoman and wsg50 packages on your PC, you don't have to download or build any of the packages under directories robot_ws/src/original_wsg_packages or robot_ws/src/original_motoman_pkgs. Just the packages in directory robot_ws/src/my_packages are sufficient for testing our implemntation in that case. So, to save your time and the memory of your PC, you can delete directories robot_ws/src/original_wsg_packages and robot_ws/src/original_motoman_pkgs before building the workspace if you already have taken care of the packages they include. However, if you have not installed those packages already, just clone this workspace on your PC and build it with catkin_make and you should be able to test our system. To test the system, follow the instructions [here](./testing_instructions.txt).
